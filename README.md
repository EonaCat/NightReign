# EonaCat Elden Ring Nightreign Save Transfer

Download the program (see Releases).

Unzip the downloaded ZIP file.

Run the executable. (Note: .NET 8.0 Runtime is required.)

Select the save file to which you want to transfer your Steam ID.

Enter your Steam ID in the popup window (you need the SteamID64 of your Steam profile).

Choose the location where the modified save file should be saved.
(The default save location should already point to the Elden Ring NightReign save directory.)

⚠️ IMPORTANT: MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR SAVE FILE BEFORE REPLACING IT!
NOTE: Steam Cloud may overwrite your modified save file.

If this happens:
Disable Steam Cloud for Elden Ring NightReign.

Copy the modified save file to the save directory.

Start the game.

If it works, you can re-enable Steam Cloud.
